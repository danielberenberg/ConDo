############################ generate features #########################
feature.c 
compile:

         gcc src/feature.c -o bin/feature -lm -fopenmp -O2
or       icc src/feature.c -o bin/feature -qopenmp -O2

run:    feature $target $Ncpu

Input files are: 
$target.fasta    # target sequence
$target.ss2      # Secondary Structure predicted by PSIPRED
$target.a22      # Solvent Accessibility predicted by SANN
$target.a3       # Solvent Accessibility by SANN
$target.ck2      # sequence profile converted from chk of blast or hhblits
$target.msa      # multiple sequence alignment converted by    of Jackhammer 
$target.ccmpred  # predicted contact by CCMPRED

Outout files are
$target_feature.txt  # input features for machine
$target_PAS3.txt     # PAS information 
result_ccm2.txt      # predicted contact after filtering 
community_ccm2.txt   # Modularity of predicted contact

How to show 
In gnuplot,
set size square
plot $target_PAS3.txt u 1:2:3, w image
plot result_ccm2.txt u 1:2:3, w image
plot community_ccm2.txt u 1:2 w lp

########################## How to run #########################

You need to set up the paths for programs and databases path of bash script (.sh) in bin directory

ConDo.sh  
run_jackhmmer.sh 
gen_features.sh 
run_ccmpred.sh

run: 
Condo.sh target.fasta $ncpu

Output file is $target.ConDo
First and second columns of the output file are residue index and domain boundary score, respectively
The cut-off of score is 1.4 
In gnuplot, 
plot "$target.ComDo" u 1:2 w lp, 1.4
